## Weight Tracking Application

### Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

This app was created to fufill the users' need to keep a log of their weight for whatever personal reason they have. The app allowed the user to have a goal weight stored as well. This goal is present for the user to see and, once reached, will notify the user via SMS message. The user is also allowed to delete entries as well as edit their goal weight. 

### What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

A login screen and a home screen were necessary for this application. The login screen handled both existing users and new users. The home screen offers a grid of the user's logged weight entries, a spot where they can see their goal weight, and buttons to add, delete, edit, and logout. If there are fields left empty, a popup view will inform the user and allow them to try again. 

### How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?

I thought I was going about it the right way but I doubt that looking back. I began with trying to create the login activity first. I should have started with making the classes, the database, the layouts, and then move to the activities. 

### How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?

Testing is very important so that you know that your code works without hiccups. It should be done requently so that errors can be caught in a manner that allows for quick and clear fixes. 

### Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

Every step of the way. The creation of the app was confusing and needed to be explained better.

### In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

I'm not entirely sure that I was able to that this at all.
